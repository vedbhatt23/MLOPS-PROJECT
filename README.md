# MLOPS-PROJECT : SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION

# Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust sign language recognition system aimed at empowering individuals who are unable to speak. The system leverages advanced object detection algorithms such as YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, MobileNetSSDv2, and MobileNetSSDv3 to accurately and efficiently detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time.

# Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to enhance communication accessibility for those who rely on sign language. By creating a tool that accurately translates sign language into text or speech, this project seeks to bridge the communication gap for non-verbal individuals, fostering greater inclusivity and independence.

# Algorithms Used
YOLOv8n: Employed for its high precision and real-time detection capabilities, allowing for swift and accurate identification of sign language gestures.

YOLOv8s: A lightweight version of YOLOv8, used to ensure efficient performance on resource-constrained devices while maintaining accuracy.

MobileNetSSDv2: Utilized for its balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, providing fast and reliable gesture detection.

MobileNetSSDv3: Incorporated for its enhanced features and optimizations, improving the accuracy and reliability of sign language recognition.

# Features
Real-Time Recognition: The system is designed to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

High Accuracy: Through the use of advanced algorithms, the system achieves high accuracy in recognizing and translating sign language.

Optimized for Efficiency: The algorithms are optimized for performance, ensuring that the system runs efficiently on a variety of devices.

# How It Works
The system captures video input, processes each frame using the selected algorithms, and identifies sign language gestures. These gestures are then translated into text or speech, enabling effective communication for individuals who are non-verbal.

# Installation and Usage
Instructions on how to install and use the system will be provided here, including any necessary dependencies and setup steps.

# Future Work
Expansion of Gesture Database: Incorporate a wider range of sign language gestures to improve the system's versatility.

Cross-Platform Deployment: Optimize the system for deployment across various platforms and devices.
